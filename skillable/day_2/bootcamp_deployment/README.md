# Bootcamp Azure deployment

This folder is a standalone export of the Lab 04 Azure foundation. It supports:

- Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) provisioning
- direct subscription-scoped Bicep deployment through PowerShell
- Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Managed Instance
- optional GitHub Actions OIDC provisioning
- exact-match Front Door Private Link approval and endpoint verification

The package contains infrastructure only. Application image build and release
are separate concerns.

## Deployment components

Exactly one database target is created:

- `sqlMi` is the default compatibility path. It requests Freemium first.
- `azureSql` is the explicit lower-cost alternative.

Do not change database mode in place. Incremental ARM deployment does not
delete resources omitted by a changed Bicep condition. Use a new environment or
remove the old environment first.

## Multi-subscription naming

Every deployment derives one stable eight-character suffix from:

- the Azure subscription resource ID
- the AZD/direct deployment environment name
- the configured resource prefix

The suffix is generated with Bicep `uniqueString()` and is deterministic. A
rerun with the same subscription, environment, and prefix targets the same
resources. Changing any seed value produces a different suffix.

The shared suffix is applied to globally unique names, including Key Vault,
Azure Container Registry, Azure SQL logical server, SQL Managed Instance, and
the Front Door endpoint. It is also used on scoped resources and resource
groups so parallel environments are easy to distinguish.

The prefix must be 3-18 lowercase alphanumeric characters with optional single
internal hyphens. It must begin and end with an alphanumeric character. Both
the AZD hook and direct deployment script enforce this contract.

Do not replace the suffix with runtime randomness such as `Get-Random`; doing
so would create different names on every deployment and break idempotent
updates.

## Prerequisites

- PowerShell 7 or later
- Azure CLI
- Azure Developer CLI for the AZD path
- .NET SDK 8 or later for the automatic SqlPackage bootstrap
- outbound HTTPS access to `https://api.nuget.org` on the first database import
- an Azure subscription where you can create subscription deployments,
  resource groups, role assignments, and a custom role
- Microsoft Graph access to resolve the signed-in Entra user or an explicitly
  supplied Entra administrator user principal name
- regional capacity and quota for VMs, DMS, zone-redundant Container Apps, and
  the selected database service

Authenticate:

```powershell
az login
azd auth login
```

## Deploy with AZD

From the repository root:

```powershell
azd env new lab04
azd up
```

The pre-provision hook:

1. selects the Azure subscription and regions
2. uses the signed-in Entra user as the SQL administrator
3. creates or recovers a compliant VM password in the local AZD environment
4. defaults to SQL Managed Instance with the Freemium pricing model
5. accepts `LAB04_SQL_MI_PRICING_MODEL=Regular` when the instructor determines
   that the subscription or region cannot use Freemium

After Bicep succeeds, the post-provision hook imports the repository-level
`data\eshop.bacpac` as `eshop_ai`. It uses the signed-in Entra administrator,
automatically obtains the deployer's public IPv4 address from
`api.ipify.org`, and grants only that `/32` temporary access. For Azure SQL it
temporarily enables the public endpoint and adds a server firewall rule. For
SQL MI it adds a temporary TCP 3342 NSG rule. The hook removes its rule and
restores Azure SQL's original public-network setting even when import fails.

The hook automatically installs pinned Microsoft.SqlPackage `170.5.96` into
the ignored project-local
`.azure\tools\sqlpackage\170.5.96` directory. It supplies nuget.org explicitly,
so it does not modify or depend on the user's persistent NuGet sources. The
verified cache is reused on later deployments and no global tool is installed.
Windows, Linux, and macOS deployment machines are supported through
PowerShell 7 and the .NET SDK.

Rerunning `azd up` preserves an existing `eshop_ai` database and skips the
import before making any network change. The deployment never drops or
replaces an existing database.

### Container App configuration

Azure Container Apps uses revision-scoped environment variables as the
equivalent of App Service App Settings. Bicep owns the stable runtime
configuration. For SQL MI, post-provision automation adds the database
connection after the managed instance exposes its generated FQDN, allowing
Container Apps and SQL MI to provision in parallel:

- `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` selects the dedicated user-assigned runtime identity.
- `ConnectionStrings__StoreDbContext` is a passwordless managed-identity
  connection string for the separate `eshop` database created later by the
  migration lab.

The BACPAC-created `eshop_ai` database remains independent and is not used by
the retail app. After migration creates `eshop`, Lab 05 grants the runtime
identity only `db_datareader` and `db_datawriter` inside that database.

Future sensitive settings should be stored in Key Vault and declared as ACA
Key Vault secret references. The runtime identity has **Key Vault Secrets
User** on the lab vault; literal secret values must not be passed through
Bicep, AZD, GitHub variables, image build arguments, or container layers.
Changing environment variables creates a new ACA revision. Updating an
app-scoped secret alone does not restart an existing revision, so secret
rotation also requires a revision restart or new revision.

### Manage deployment locations

The Bicep entry point defines `centralus` as the default for the primary,
secondary, and application locations. No location configuration is required to
use those defaults; the pre-provision hook mirrors them into the AZD
environment before deployment.

To deploy to different supported regions, set one or more location values
before running `azd up`:

```powershell
azd env set LAB04_PRIMARY_LOCATION centralus
azd env set LAB04_SECONDARY_LOCATION eastus2
azd env set LAB04_APPLICATION_LOCATION centralus
azd up
```

The values map to the Bicep `primaryLocation`, `secondaryLocation`, and
`applicationLocation` parameters, respectively. AZD environment values persist
for subsequent deployments of that environment.

Confirm VM, DMS, SQL MI or Azure SQL, and zone-redundant Container Apps
availability and quota before selecting different regions. Do not change
locations in place for an environment that already contains regional
resources. Use a new AZD environment or remove the existing deployment first.

The signed-in deployment user is the default and requires no SQL administrator
input. To select a different Entra user, set the optional override before
deployment:

```powershell
azd env set LAB04_SQL_ADMIN_LOGIN_OVERRIDE '<user-principal-name>'
azd up
```

The hook resolves the effective login and object ID on every run. It stores
those resolved values as `LAB04_SQL_ADMIN_LOGIN` and
`LAB04_SQL_ADMIN_OBJECT_ID` for the Bicep parameter mapping; they are outputs,
not administrator-selection inputs.

The Bicep entry point also defaults `sqlEntraAdminLogin` and
`sqlEntraAdminObjectId` from `deployer()`, so an interactive user invoking
`infra/main.bicep` directly does not need to supply either parameter. Service
principals and managed identities usually have no user principal name and must
provide both values explicitly. Any override must provide a matching login and
object ID.

To select the paid General Purpose fallback before instructor provisioning:

```powershell
azd env set LAB04_SQL_MI_PRICING_MODEL Regular
azd up
```

Freemium provides 4 vCores, 64 GB of storage, and 720 vCore-hours per month for
12 months on one eligible instance per subscription. The paid `Regular` model
uses the same General Purpose v2 lab shape but incurs normal Azure charges.

AZD local state under `.azure/<environment>` can contain generated VM
credentials and must not be committed or shared.

## Enable participant SQL MI access

Infrastructure is deployed before participants begin the lab. SQL MI keeps its
VNet-local endpoint and also exposes the public endpoint on TCP 3342, but the
deployment does not allow arbitrary internet traffic.

An instructor must grant each participant **Network Contributor** on only the
SQL MI network security group. If the participant needs automatic endpoint
discovery, also grant **Reader** on the SQL MI resource; otherwise provide the
`LAB04_SQL_MI_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` deployment output.

After `az login`, the participant runs:

```powershell
.\assets\scripts\Enable-Lab04SqlMiPublicAccess.ps1 `
  -SubscriptionId '<subscription-id>'
```

The script asks before using `api.ipify.org`, validates the returned public
IPv4 address, and idempotently creates or updates one TCP 3342 rule for that
participant's `/32`. Its default rule name is a deterministic, privacy-safe
hash of the selected subscription, tenant, and signed-in Azure account, so it
does not require Microsoft Graph access or expose participant identity. It then
waits for the public hostname to resolve and for TCP 3342 to be reachable from
the participant's machine. This verifies the public network path, not a SQL
login or query; Microsoft Entra authentication and database authorization are
still required.
Participants can avoid external discovery and supply the address:

```powershell
.\assets\scripts\Enable-Lab04SqlMiPublicAccess.ps1 `
  -SubscriptionId '<subscription-id>' `
  -IpAddress '<public-ipv4>' `
  -ResourceGroupName '<secondary-resource-group>' `
  -NetworkSecurityGroupName '<sqlmi-nsg-name>' `
  -PublicEndpoint '<sqlmi-public-hostname>,3342' `
  -RuleName 'AllowSqlMi-<instructor-provided-unique-value>'
```

Rerun the script whenever the participant's public IP changes. Connect from
SSMS with a Microsoft Entra authentication method; SQL authentication remains
disabled. `-RuleName` remains available as an optional override; keep the same
unique override value on every rerun.

## Deploy Bicep directly

The direct script supports validation, what-if, and deployment:

```powershell
$subscriptionId = '<subscription-id>'

.\infra\Deploy-Lab04.ps1 `
  -SubscriptionId $subscriptionId `
  -EnvironmentName 'lab04-direct' `
  -Action Validate

.\infra\Deploy-Lab04.ps1 `
  -SubscriptionId $subscriptionId `
  -EnvironmentName 'lab04-direct' `
  -DeploymentLocation 'eastus2' `
  -PrimaryLocation 'centralus' `
  -SecondaryLocation 'eastus2' `
  -ApplicationLocation 'centralus' `
  -Action WhatIf

.\infra\Deploy-Lab04.ps1 `
  -SubscriptionId $subscriptionId `
  -EnvironmentName 'lab04-direct' `
  -Action Deploy
```

`Deploy` uses `--confirm-with-what-if`, approves only the deterministic Front
Door Private Link request, and waits for the public Front Door endpoint to
respond successfully. It then runs the same idempotent BACPAC import as the
AZD post-provision hook. `Validate` and `WhatIf` do not install SqlPackage,
discover a public IP, or change SQL networking.

`DeploymentLocation` controls the subscription deployment record.
`PrimaryLocation`, `SecondaryLocation`, and `ApplicationLocation` control the
deployed resource regions. When omitted, the deployment location follows the
primary location and all resource locations default to `centralus`.

See the [direct deployment guide](./infra/DEPLOYMENT.md) for location parameters,
SQL MI selection, password rules, the optional Entra administrator user
principal name, reruns, and diagnostics.

## Optional GitHub OIDC

First deploy locally with AZD or the direct script. Then run the setup utility
from a Git repository where the authenticated GitHub account has `ADMIN`
permission.

Run these commands from the bootcamp deployment directory:

```powershell
Set-Location (Join-Path (git rev-parse --show-toplevel) 'skillable\day_2\bootcamp_deployment')
```

For AZD:

```powershell
.\assets\scripts\Configure-Lab04GitHub.ps1 `
  -SubscriptionId '<subscription-id>' `
  -AzdEnvironment 'lab04' `
  -Repository 'owner/repository' `
  -RequiredReviewer '<github-user-login>' `
  -DeploymentBranch 'main'
```

For direct Bicep:

```powershell
.\assets\scripts\Configure-Lab04GitHub.ps1 `
  -SubscriptionId '<subscription-id>' `
  -DeploymentName 'lab04-direct-deploy' `
  -Repository 'owner/repository' `
  -RequiredReviewer '<github-user-login>' `
  -DeploymentBranch 'main'
```

AZD and direct ARM outputs are stored separately. Always use
`-DeploymentName <EnvironmentName>-deploy` after `Deploy-Lab04.ps1`.
If the direct deployment used its optional `-DeploymentName` override, pass
that exact name to `Configure-Lab04GitHub.ps1` instead.

If PowerShell reports that `DeploymentName` is not a recognized parameter,
confirm that the command resolves to this checkout and exposes the current
`Arm` parameter set:

```powershell
$oidcScript = Get-Command .\assets\scripts\Configure-Lab04GitHub.ps1
$oidcScript.Source
$oidcScript.ParameterSets |
  Select-Object Name, @{ Name = 'Parameters'; Expression = { $_.Parameters.Name -join ', ' } }
```

The `Arm` row must include `DeploymentName`. If it does not, update the
checkout or remove the stale script copy being invoked; changing the Azure
deployment name will not fix a PowerShell parameter-binding error.

For a hosted platform deployed through separate resource-group-scope
deployments, configure only the Lab 06 build and deployment environments with:

```powershell
.\assets\scripts\Initialize-Lab06RepositoryFromResourceGroups.ps1 `
  -SubscriptionId '<subscription-id>' `
  -Repository 'owner/repository' `
  -RequiredReviewer '<github-user-login>' `
  -DeploymentBranch 'main'
```

The script discovers the newest successful deployment in each resource group
by its output contract rather than its name. It requires consistent `prefix`
and `suffix` parameters across the selected deployments, validates the existing
identities, resources, and RBAC, and then configures `lab06` and
`lab06-deploy`. Use the optional `-BootstrapDeploymentName`,
`-PrimaryDeploymentName`, `-SecondaryDeploymentName`, or
`-GlobalDeploymentName` parameters to select a specific historical deployment.
The script discovers each resource group independently from its
`rg-caldova-lab04-bootstrap-`, `rg-caldova-lab04-primary-`,
`rg-caldova-lab04-secondary-`, or `rg-caldova-lab04-global-` prefix. If more
than one group matches a prefix, pass that role's resource-group override.

Required reviewers are available for public repositories and private
repositories on GitHub Enterprise. For a private lab repository on GitHub
Free, Pro, or Team, explicitly opt out of the unsupported manual approval rule:

```powershell
.\assets\scripts\Initialize-Lab06RepositoryFromResourceGroups.ps1 `
  -SubscriptionId '<subscription-id>' `
  -Repository 'owner/repository' `
  -AllowDeploymentWithoutRequiredReviewer `
  -DeploymentBranch 'main'
```

Fallback mode retains the `main` branch restriction, emits a warning, and does
not create a manual approval gate.

Test the same discovery and print its JSON result without changing Azure
resources or GitHub:

```powershell
.\assets\scripts\Test-Lab06ResourceGroupDeploymentValues.ps1 `
  -SubscriptionId '<subscription-id>'
```

### Standalone post-deployment automation

For infrastructure deployed as separate resource-group deployments, run all
Lab 04 post-deployment actions without rerunning Bicep:

```powershell
.\assets\scripts\Invoke-Lab04PostDeploymentFromResourceGroups.ps1 `
  -SubscriptionId '<subscription-id>'
```

The script independently discovers the bootstrap, secondary, and global
resource groups by their fixed prefixes and selects the newest deployments
matching the required output contracts. It supports the hosted SQL Managed
Instance layout, approves only the expected Front Door Private Link request,
waits for Front Door health, imports `eshop.bacpac` through temporary
`/32` NSG access, removes that access in a `finally` block, and configures the
Container App managed-identity database settings.

Preview discovered values without mutation:

```powershell
.\assets\scripts\Invoke-Lab04PostDeploymentFromResourceGroups.ps1 `
  -SubscriptionId '<subscription-id>' `
  -DiscoveryOnly
```

`-WhatIf` prints the same discovery with an action summary. Resource-group and
deployment-name parameters remain available as ambiguity overrides.
`-BacpacPath` overrides local discovery. When import is needed, the standalone
script searches beside itself, local and ancestor `data` directories, and the
current working directory. It embeds its SqlPackage helper logic, uses a
per-user tool cache, and can run from a copied directory such as
`C:\Labfiles` without a Git checkout. Existing `eshop_ai` databases are
preserved by default; deletion and reimport require
`-ReplaceExistingDatabase`.

The setup creates separate identities for:

- infrastructure preview
- infrastructure deployment
- application image build/push
- application deployment

It also creates `lab04`, `lab04-deploy`, `lab06`, and `lab06-deploy` GitHub
environments, configures deployment protection, publishes non-secret
variables, and creates environment-scoped federated credentials.

Required reviewers depend on the repository's GitHub plan. The setup fails
instead of silently omitting the protection rule.

## Security posture and lab exceptions

This is a training deployment, not a complete production landing zone.

### Intentionally private

- VMs have no public IP addresses and are accessed through Bastion.
- Azure SQL disables public database access. SQL MI retains private VNet
  connectivity and enables its public data endpoint for the migration lab.
- The Container Apps environment is internal.
- Front Door reaches Container Apps through Private Link.
- Key Vault uses Azure RBAC.
- Managed identities and OIDC avoid stored Azure client secrets.

### Intentionally public or simplified

- Front Door is the public application entry point.
- Bastion exposes its managed public endpoint.
- ACR Basic retains public network access for GitHub-hosted runners, but its
  admin account is disabled and access uses scoped RBAC.
- SQL MI public TCP 3342 remains blocked until a participant script adds one
  validated public IPv4 `/32` rule to the NSG.
- Database initialization briefly adds one deployment-scoped `/32` rule and
  removes it after SqlPackage finishes. Azure SQL public access is restored to
  disabled.
- The lab does not provide enterprise hub-spoke networking, Firewall,
  DDoS Network Protection, centralized Private DNS, policy assignments, SIEM
  integration, or full multi-region disaster recovery.
- Direct deployment can automatically approve one exact Front Door Private
  Link request. Production environments often preserve a separate approval
  boundary.

For production, deploy inside an
[Azure Landing Zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/)
and evaluate the
[Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/well-architected/)
security, reliability, cost, operational excellence, and performance guidance.

## Validation

Build the subscription entry point:

```powershell
az bicep build --file .\infra\main.bicep --stdout | Out-Null
```

Validate the GitHub OIDC, workflow, PowerShell, and Bicep parameter contracts:

```powershell
.\tests\Validate-Lab04OidcContracts.ps1
```

Validate the Lab 06 resource-group deployment discovery and OIDC contracts:

```powershell
.\tests\Validate-Lab06ResourceGroupOidcContracts.ps1
```

Validate standalone resource-group post-deployment automation contracts:

```powershell
.\tests\Validate-Lab04PostDeploymentContracts.ps1
```

Validate BACPAC import naming, module, hook, path, and temporary-rule
contracts without changing Azure resources:

```powershell
.\tests\Validate-Lab04DatabaseImportContracts.ps1
```

Validate SQL MI public endpoint parsing and DNS/TCP readiness behavior without
changing Azure resources:

```powershell
.\tests\Validate-Lab04SqlMiConnectivity.ps1
```

Validate deterministic, privacy-safe participant NSG rule naming without
changing Azure resources:

```powershell
.\tests\Validate-Lab04SqlMiPublicAccess.ps1
```

Parse the PowerShell scripts:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem . -Filter *.ps1 -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
  $tokens = $null
  $errors = $null
  [void][System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile(
    $_.FullName,
    [ref]$tokens,
    [ref]$errors
  )
  if ($errors.Count) {
    throw "$($_.FullName): $($errors -join '; ')"
  }
}
```

## Cleanup

For an AZD environment:

```powershell
azd down --purge
```

For exact resource-group cleanup:

```powershell
.\assets\scripts\Remove-Lab04Environment.ps1 `
  -SubscriptionId '<subscription-id>' `
  -Prefix 'caldova-lab04' `
  -Suffix '<eight-character-suffix>' `
  -Confirm
```

Review the four exact resource-group names before confirming deletion.
